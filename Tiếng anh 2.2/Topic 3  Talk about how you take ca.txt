Topic 3 : Talk about how you take care of your appearance 
Hello teacher , my name is Phát . Today, I would like to talk about my way to take care of my appearance. First of all, I want to share with you about how I think about my appearance and how I take care of it.I rarely leave the house so I just take care of my appearance by I use skin care products and that time usually appear once a week. Yes , Im so glad because my appearance looks like a normal person , I don't lack anything, and I'm still happy compared to the unhappy fates out there. I always take care of my hair by I’m going to hair salon every time my hair so long. I don’t waste so much money on cosmetic products because im man and if you are man , you rarely take care of your skin.Secondly, I would like to talk about a place I usually to go to take care of my appearance.I often go barber shop and I go barber shop two times of week.
My favorite barber shop is  Bi Barber. It located on Vũng Tàu city. I usually go there with my friend. Every time I go there I will be they free massage. I have to pay sixty thousand Viet nam dong. Finally, it is about cosmetic surgery . I think cosmetic surgery sometimes good sometimes bad. Because, if you know to use right way you will receive good result but if you don’t know to use right way or excessive abuse , your appearance will be destroyed by cutlery.The advantages of cosmetic surgery is improve the beauty of your face. The advantages of cosmetic surgery is you waste a lot of money to just edit a small part of your face.If I had money , I wouldn’t have cosmetic surgery because I felt satisfied about my appearance and I don’t have demand to improve my face. That is end of my speaking . Thank you for listening.
